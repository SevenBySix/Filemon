#This will be the class that will hold a Filemons properties
#the player class will contain some sort of array of FileMon objects
#So when
#An individual mon will ultimately have various text labels and stats attached to it
#in order to do things like trade and battle we will need mon objects to work with
#so that we are not having to constantly modify a mon object in the players inventory
#itll look kinda like making an instance of a mon based on an existing mon of the player
#and later after no changes are happening to that mon, putting that mon instance back where it
#came from, or in the case of trading deleting it and adding the newly recieved mon instance
