We are going to need something that writes to some sort of text file
This text file will ultimately be the players save file

class Save_Manager():

    def __init__(self):

        pass


    '''
    This should log the players position within their file structure

    def writePosition(self):

        pass
    '''
    This should return a string corresponding to the path that the world
    needs to start in
